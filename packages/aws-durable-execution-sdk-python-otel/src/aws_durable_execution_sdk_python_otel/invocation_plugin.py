    """OpenTelemetry instrumentation plugin for durable executions.

    The plugin creates spans for Lambda invocations, durable operations, and
    user-function attempts. Workflow and Invocation spans share one execution
    trace, parented to a propagated backend parent when present or a
    deterministic synthetic execution root otherwise. Invocation spans use the
    active ambient span only when it is already on that execution trace.
    Operation spans remain parented to the Invocation span and link to the
    Workflow span.

    Operation IDs are converted into deterministic span IDs. The first observed
    span for an operation uses that deterministic ID; later continuation spans
    use newly generated span IDs. Operation attributes and links to the Workflow
    span provide execution-scoped correlation across invocations.

    Args:
        config: Shared plugin configuration (the same OtelPluginConfig accepted
            by ExecutionOtelPlugin). When omitted, defaults are used (X-Ray
            extractor, "Workflow" span name, log enrichment on) and the plugin
            uses the globally configured tracer provider (for example, the
            provider installed by the ADOT Lambda layer).

        the globally configured provider is used.

        The plugin tracer is configured with a scoped deterministic ID generator
        so durable spans share stable identifiers without changing unrelated
        instrumentation scopes on the same provider.
