# AWS Durable Execution SDK - OpenTelemetry Plugin

OpenTelemetry instrumentation plugin for the [AWS Durable Execution SDK for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-durable-execution-sdk-python). Emits durable execution spans on one execution trace, with deterministic workflow, synthetic-root, and operation span IDs.

## Features

- **Shared Execution Trace**: Workflow and Invocation spans share one trace, anchored to a propagated backend parent when available or a deterministic synthetic execution root otherwise
- **Same-Trace Ambient Parenting**: Invocation spans use the active ambient span only when it already belongs to the execution trace
- **Span-per-Operation**: Each durable operation (step, wait, invoke) gets its own span with accurate timing
- **Continuation Spans**: Operations completing in another invocation produce a new correlated span without fabricating an unobserved prior span context
- **Log Correlation**: Enrich application logs with trace ID and span ID for end-to-end observability
- **Provider Integration**: Use the global ADOT provider or supply an explicit SDK `TracerProvider`
- **Execution Sampling**: Resolve sampling once per invocation and apply it consistently to Workflow, Invocation, operation, and attempt spans

## Installation

When using an ADOT or community OpenTelemetry Lambda layer:

```bash
pip install aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel
```

The base package intentionally does not install OpenTelemetry libraries. The
Lambda layer supplies a version-aligned API, SDK, exporter, and propagators,
preventing packages in the function artifact from shadowing parts of the layer.

For an application that configures its own OpenTelemetry provider instead of
using a Lambda layer:

```bash
pip install "aws-durable-execution-sdk-python-otel[standalone]"
```

The `standalone` extra installs the OpenTelemetry API, SDK, and AWS X-Ray
propagator. The application remains responsible for configuring its provider,
processors, and exporter.

## Quick Start using X-Ray/CloudWatch Tracing

1. Add the [ADOT Lambda Layer](#1-adot-lambda-layer) to your function and set `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument`
2. Enable [X-Ray Active Tracing](#2-aws-x-ray-active-tracing) on the function
3. Pass `InvocationOtelPlugin` to your handler's `plugins` list
4. Add X-Ray write permissions

Alternatively, install this package in the function artifact or a Lambda layer
and select either OTel plugin by entry-point name:

```text
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=otel-invocation
DURABLE_EXECUTION_PLUGINS=otel-execution
```

`otel-invocation` creates `InvocationOtelPlugin`; `otel-execution` creates
`ExecutionOtelPlugin`. The SDK discovers the selected package entry point at
cold start, so the handler does not need to import or explicitly register the
plugin.

### 1. ADOT Lambda Layer

This plugin requires the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Lambda layer](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda) to export traces from your Lambda function.

The layer ARN follows the format:

```
arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<awsAccountId>:layer:aws-otel-python-<arch>-ver-<version>
```

Refer to the [ADOT Lambda Layer ARNs](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-python) page for the latest version number, architecture, and supported regions.

**AWS CLI:**

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name your-function-name \
  --layers "arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<awsAccountId>:layer:aws-otel-python-amd64-ver-<version>"
```

You must also set the `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` environment variable:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name your-function-name \
  --environment "Variables={AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument}"
```

> **Note:** Replace `<region>` with your function's region and `<version>`/`<arch>` with the latest layer version and architecture from the ADOT docs.

**CloudFormation / SAM:**

```yaml
MyFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    Layers:
      - !Sub arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:<awsAccountId>:layer:aws-otel-python-amd64-ver-<version>
    Environment:
      Variables:
        AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER: /opt/otel-instrument
```

**CDK:**

```python
from aws_cdk import aws_lambda as lambda_

adot_layer = lambda_.LayerVersion.from_layer_version_arn(
    self,
    "AdotLayer",
    f"arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<awsAccountId>:layer:aws-otel-python-amd64-ver-<version>",
)

fn = lambda_.Function(
    self,
    "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset("lambda"),
    layers=[adot_layer],
    environment={"AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER": "/opt/otel-instrument"},
)
```

> **Tip:** Pin the layer version to a specific number in production deployments to avoid unexpected behavior from automatic version changes.

### 2. AWS X-Ray Active Tracing

Enable active tracing on your Lambda function so the `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` environment variable is populated at invocation time. The plugin uses this header to anchor the execution trace on the propagated X-Ray `Root`/`Parent` when both are valid, and preserves `Sampled=1` or `Sampled=0` as the backend sampling decision.

**AWS Console:** Lambda → Configuration → Monitoring and operations tools → Active tracing → Enable

**AWS CLI:**

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name your-function-name \
  --tracing-config Mode=Active
```

**CloudFormation / SAM:**

```yaml
MyFunction:
  Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
  Properties:
    TracingConfig:
      Mode: Active
```

**CDK:**

```python
lambda_.Function(
    self,
    "MyFunction",
    tracing=lambda_.Tracing.ACTIVE,
)
```

### 3. In your Lambda handler (index.py)

```python
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python import DurableContext
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python.execution import durable_execution
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_otel import InvocationOtelPlugin


@durable_execution(plugins=[InvocationOtelPlugin()])
def handler(event: dict, context: DurableContext) -> dict:
    result = context.step(lambda _: fetch_data(event["id"]), name="fetch-data")

    context.wait(duration=Duration.from_seconds(5))

    context.step(lambda _: process(result), name="process")

    return result
```

The ADOT layer supplies the global `TracerProvider`; the plugin handles
deterministic ID generation and span lifecycle.

### 4. Grant Permissions

The function's execution role needs the `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` managed policy (or equivalent permissions) if using X-Ray as the tracing backend.

### Environment Variables for ADOT layer

| Variable                      | Description                                                                                   | Default           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Endpoint for the OTLP exporter (e.g., `http://localhost:4318` for the ADOT collector sidecar) | Set by ADOT layer |
| `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER`     | Set to `/opt/otel-instrument` for the ADOT layer to instrument your function                  | —                 |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`         | Sampler to use (e.g., `traceidratio` for ratio-based sampling)                                | `always_on`       |
| `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`     | Argument for the sampler (e.g., `0.3` to sample 30% of traces)                                | —                 |

See the [ADOT sampling configuration](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda#sampling-configuration) for more details. When the backend header contains an explicit `Sampled` value, that backend decision takes precedence over local sampler configuration for durable spans.

## Configuration

### Plugin Options

```python
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_otel import (
    InvocationOtelPlugin,
    OtelPluginConfig,
    xray_context_extractor,
)

plugin = InvocationOtelPlugin(
    OtelPluginConfig(
        # Use a custom context extractor (default: xray_context_extractor).
        context_extractor=xray_context_extractor,
        # Custom instrumentation scope name
        # (default: "aws-durable-execution-sdk-python").
        instrument_name="my-service",
        # Install a root-logger filter that stamps trace context onto every
        # log record (default: True).
        enrich_logger=True,
    )
)
```

### Context Extractors

Context extractors return an `ExtractedContext` object, or `None` when no
durable execution trace context is available. The object carries:

- `trace_id`: 128-bit OpenTelemetry trace ID
- `parent_span_id`: 64-bit OpenTelemetry parent span ID
- `sampling`: `Sampling.SAMPLED`, `Sampling.NOT_SAMPLED`, or `Sampling.UNDECIDED`

The plugin supports multiple strategies for extracting durable execution trace
context:

```python
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python_otel import (
    InvocationOtelPlugin,
    OtelPluginConfig,
    w3c_client_context_extractor,
    xray_context_extractor,
)

# Default: X-Ray trace header (recommended for most Lambda deployments).
InvocationOtelPlugin(OtelPluginConfig(context_extractor=xray_context_extractor))

# W3C Trace Context via clientContext (placeholder for backend propagation support).
InvocationOtelPlugin(OtelPluginConfig(context_extractor=w3c_client_context_extractor))
```

Custom extractors should return `ExtractedContext`, not an OpenTelemetry
`Context`.

### Trace Structure

Both bundled plugins use the same execution ancestor:

- a propagated backend parent when `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` contains a valid `Root`
  and `Parent`
- otherwise a deterministic, non-recording synthetic root derived from the
  durable execution ARN

`InvocationOtelPlugin` keeps durable operation spans under the Invocation span
and links operations to Workflow:

```text
Execution ancestor
├── Workflow
└── Invocation
    └── operation
        └── operation attempt 1
```

`ExecutionOtelPlugin` keeps operation spans under Workflow and links operations
to the current Invocation span:

```text
Execution ancestor
├── Workflow
│   └── operation
│       └── operation attempt 1
└── Invocation
```

If an ambient Lambda span is active and already has the execution trace ID, the
Invocation span uses that ambient span as its parent. Ambient spans on a
different trace are ignored for durable parenting so Invocation remains on the
execution trace.

### Sampling

Sampling is resolved once per invocation and carried to every durable span in
that invocation. Precedence is:

1. `Sampled=1` or `Sampled=0` from `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID`
2. a same-trace ambient span's recording/sampled state
3. the configured OpenTelemetry sampler

The resolved decision is applied to Workflow, Invocation, operation, and attempt
spans. This avoids independently querying stateful or ratio-based samplers for
each durable span in the same invocation.

### Log Correlation

When `enrich_logger=True` (the default), the plugin installs a logging filter on
the root logger at invocation start. The filter stamps the active OTel trace
context onto every emitted log record using these attributes:

- `traceId`: 32-char hex trace identifier
- `spanId`: 16-char hex span identifier
- `otelTraceSampled`: boolean indicating if the trace is sampled

These attributes are only set when a valid span context is active, so any log
formatter or schema must treat the fields as optional.

## Verification

After deploying your function with the plugin configured:

1. **Invoke your durable function** — trigger at least one execution that includes multiple steps or a wait/resume cycle.

2. **Check the CloudWatch console** — Navigate to CloudWatch → Traces in the AWS Console. You should see an execution trace with:
   - A "Workflow" span exported on the terminal invocation
   - An "Invocation" span per invocation
   - Child spans for each durable operation (named after your step names)
   - All invocations of the same execution grouped under one trace ID

3. **Check log correlation** — verify that your logs include `traceId` and `spanId` fields matching the spans in X-Ray.

4. **Confirm sampling** — If you set `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=traceidratio` and `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` to a value less than 1.0, verify that only the expected proportion of traces appear.

5. **Span links** — For operations that span multiple invocations (e.g., after a wait resumes), though span links are set, they are not visualized within the CloudWatch console.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom                           | Likely Cause                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No traces appear                  | ADOT layer not configured, or `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` not set |
| Traces appear but are fragmented  | Backend trace context is not propagated to every invocation     |
| Missing spans for some operations | `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` set below 1.0                         |
| `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` not populated  | X-Ray active tracing not enabled                                |

## API Reference

### `InvocationOtelPlugin`

Invocation-rooted view. Implements `DurableInstrumentationPlugin` from `aws_durable_execution_sdk_python`.

```python
InvocationOtelPlugin(
    OtelPluginConfig(
        tracer_provider=None,
        context_extractor=None,
        instrument_name="aws-durable-execution-sdk-python",
        enrich_logger=True,
        workflow_span_name="Workflow",
    )
)
```

Pass `tracer_provider=...` when the application owns the OpenTelemetry SDK
provider. When omitted, the globally configured provider is used.

### `ExecutionOtelPlugin`

Execution-rooted view. Uses the same execution ancestor and sampling behavior as
`InvocationOtelPlugin`, but parents operation spans under Workflow and links
them to Invocation.

### `DeterministicIdGenerator`

A custom OpenTelemetry `IdGenerator` that produces reproducible trace and span IDs from execution metadata. Exported for advanced use cases.

### `xray_context_extractor`

Default context extractor. Reads the `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` environment variable and
returns `ExtractedContext` containing parsed `Root`, `Parent`, and `Sampled`
fields when present.

### `w3c_client_context_extractor`

Alternative context extractor placeholder. Returns `None` until backend W3C
`traceparent` propagation is supported.

### `ContextExtractor`

Type alias for custom context extractor functions:
`Callable[[InvocationStartInfo], ExtractedContext | None]`.

### `ExtractedContext` / `Sampling`

Structured trace context and sampling decision returned by context extractors.

### `OtelContextLogFilter` / `install_log_filter`

The logging filter (and its installer) used to stamp trace context onto log
records. Installed automatically when `enrich_logger=True`; exported for manual
setups.
