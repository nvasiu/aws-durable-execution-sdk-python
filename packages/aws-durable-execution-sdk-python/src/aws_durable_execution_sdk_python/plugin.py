        mutating ``info.execution_input`` would change the handler's event and so
        alter execution behaviour, and a handler mutating its event would change
        what this frozen info -- and the invocation-end info derived from it --

        immediately after this hook, so a lazily-taken snapshot could already
        have observed the handler's mutations. It is skipped when no plugins are
        registered, so non-plugin executions pay nothing.
