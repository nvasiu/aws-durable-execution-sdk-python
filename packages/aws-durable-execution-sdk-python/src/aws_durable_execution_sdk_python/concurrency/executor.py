    Scheduling model: a single coordinator loop runs on the calling thread
    and owns all branch state. Worker threads run branches and report each
    outcome as a :class:`BranchEvent` on a queue; they never mutate shared
    state, so the module needs no locks.

    ``max_concurrency`` bounds in-flight branches, not threads. A branch
    that suspends (e.g. awaiting an invoke result or callback) keeps its
    concurrency slot until it reaches a terminal state. New branches start
    only when a slot frees up. When every in-flight branch is suspended and
    no slot is available, the parent suspends too: with the earliest resume
    timestamp when one exists, indefinitely otherwise.

    Branches are always started in index order and operation ids derive
    from the branch index, so scheduling is deterministic across
    invocations. On re-invocation the previously started branches are
    admitted first and replay from their checkpoints.
