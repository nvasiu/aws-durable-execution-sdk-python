        """Create a checkpoint with optional synchronous behavior.

        This method enqueues a checkpoint operation for processing by the background
        batching thread. By default, the operation is synchronous (blocking) to ensure
        the checkpoint is persisted before continuing. For performance-critical paths
        where immediate confirmation is not required, set is_sync=False.

        Synchronous checkpoints (is_sync=True, default):
        - Block the caller until the checkpoint is processed by the background thread
        - Ensure the checkpoint is persisted before continuing
        - Safe default for correctness
        - Use cases: Most operations requiring confirmation before proceeding

        Asynchronous checkpoints (is_sync=False, opt-in):
        - Return immediately without waiting for the checkpoint to complete
        - Performance optimization for specific use cases
        - Use cases: observability checkpoints, fire-and-forget operations

        When to use synchronous checkpoints (is_sync=True, default):
        1. Step START with AtMostOncePerRetry semantics - prevents duplicate execution
        2. Operation completion (SUCCEED/FAIL) - ensures state persisted before returning
        3. Retry operations - ensures retry state recorded before continuing
        4. Callback START - must wait for API to generate callback ID
        5. Invoke START - ensures chained invoke recorded before proceeding
        6. Child context results - ensures results persisted before returning
        7. Large results - ensures results saved before returning to caller
        8. Wait for condition completion - ensures state recorded before proceeding
        9. Most operations - safe default

        When to use asynchronous checkpoints (is_sync=False, opt-in):
        1. Step START with AtLeastOncePerRetry semantics - performance optimization
        2. Child context START - fire-and-forget for performance
        3. Wait for condition START - observability only, no blocking needed
        4. Any checkpoint where immediate confirmation is not required AND performance matters

                            operations list.
            is_sync: If True (default), blocks until the checkpoint is processed.
                    If False, returns immediately without blocking for performance.

        Raises:
            OrphanedChildException: If the operation's parent context has already
                completed, or the execution itself has already completed, so the

            BackgroundThreadError: If background checkpoint processing has failed;
                the stored failure is re-raised to the caller. For a synchronous
                checkpoint, a later background failure also surfaces here through
                the completion event.
