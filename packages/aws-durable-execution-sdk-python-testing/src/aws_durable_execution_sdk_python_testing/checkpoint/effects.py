"""Lifecycle effects produced by applying checkpoint updates.

Applying a batch of operation updates can imply actions on the execution
beyond the state change itself: the execution completed, it failed, or a
callback was created and now needs a timeout. These are returned as data
so the caller can act on them after the write finishes, rather than
triggering them in the middle of it.
